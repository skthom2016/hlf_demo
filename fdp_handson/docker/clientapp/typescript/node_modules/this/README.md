Useful in tests so you don't have to require the package you're testing via relative paths.

Starts directory traversal from `process.cwd()` so this should really only be used in tests or CLI apps.

## Install

```shell
npm install --save this
```

Or if using for tests you'll probably want:

```shell
npm install --save-dev this
```

## Usage

Just require `this` the same way you would require the root module with a relative path.

e.g instead of:

```js
import test from 'ava';
import myPackage from '../';

// and then in sub folders
import myPackage from '../../';
```

You can now do:

```js
import test from 'ava';
import myPackage from 'this';

// and then in sub folders it's still just:
import myPackage from 'this';
```

e.g without import transpilation:

```js
const test = require('tape');
const myPackage = require('this');
```
